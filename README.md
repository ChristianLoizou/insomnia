## What is insomnia?
*_insomnia_* is an application I work on when I'm bored / up late. If I get any random ideas, I'll try to implement them here.
_It's the 'Jack of all trades'_ of coding projects. 

_All code in this repo was written by Christian A Loizou._
I log the chronological order in which I implement my ideas with 'I- numbers'. Next to anything I'm working on / have already completed there will be an I-number.
