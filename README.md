## What is insomnia?:
"insomnia" is an application I work on when I'm bored / awake. If I get any random ideas, I'll try to implement them here.
> _It's the 'Jack of all trades'_ of coding projects.

Languages currently in use in _*insomnia*_:
* Python3
* HTML - using Jinja2
* CSS3 - using SASS / SCSS

Languages to come?:
* P5.js - if I can hook it up to the Flask App
* Javascript plain - If I can't get P5.js working
* JQuery?
* SQL?
* Any others I can think of inmplementing...
